= About this project =

Wiki2touch was a GPL project created by Tom Haukap (haukap.net) and others. It runs in background as a daemon on a jailbroken iPhone OS, providing offline pages from mediawiki (i.e. Wikipedia) dumps.

This project was my attempt to create a standalone App instead of a daemon. And the majority of the codes are derived from 'wikisrvd' of Wiki2touch, rev 137.


= Source codes =

As for now, the source code for the original 'wikisrvd' (plus my hack for math support) is in the svn directory _branches/wikisrvd_. 

However, no sources of the tools like indexer/gen/pack etc., is available at my best knowledge. Perhaps these can be reproduced sometime in future.
