This project holds the code for Wiki2touch Server on the Big Boss repository.

Wiki2touch Server (wikisrvd) now can be compiled and run on Mac OS X, Linux and iOS as a daemon or a component of a UI frontend.

**Update:**

As Tom Haukap decides to restart the original Wiki2Touch project, this fork is going to be frozen until the upstream is ready. (2012/Feb/8)

Note for iOS 5 users:

The package on BigBoss may be broken on iOS 5.x. A temporary work-around is to download and install wikisrvd-1.2.20100515.deb manually:

  * in command line, login as root, change to directory of deb file, and then type :
> > `dpkg -i wikisrvd-1.2.20100515.deb`
  * or use cydia's Deb install feature, see:
